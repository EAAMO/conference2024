The fourth ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO ‘24) will take place **October 29-31, 2024**, in San Luis Potosi, Mexico at the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí ([UASLP](https://www.uaslp.mx/)). 

The event will highlight work along the research-to-practice pipeline to improve access to opportunity for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities and mitigate harms concerning inequitable and unsafe outcomes. In particular, we seek contributions from different fields that offer insights into the intersectional design and impacts of algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design with a grounding in the social sciences and humanistic studies. Submissions include research, surveys, position papers, and problem- and practice-driven submissions by academics and practitioners from different disciplines or sectors.
