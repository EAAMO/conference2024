### **Description**
The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) and the Equity and Access in Algorithms and Optimization (EAAMO) are two organizations focused on improving the lives of underserved and underrepresented communities. Their shared principles of incorporating local voices and bridging research and practice in policymaking underpin this panel discussion. Members from both organizations will explore how J-PAL’s randomized interventions and EAAMO’s algorithmic designs can create synergies to enhance impact.
