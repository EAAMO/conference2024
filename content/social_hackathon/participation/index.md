- The solution must be a functional application.
- Contestants can use any technology. In other words, there is no limit to the type of technology and technology stack that teams can use.
- There is no limit to the type of app/system (web, desktop, or mobile app, interactive dashboards, portal, etc.) that teams can design and develop.
- The decision must be **legal**, it must not contribute to and encourage the commission of misdemeanours and criminal acts.
- The solution must be original and authentic.
- The source code of a solution must be available at GitHub (on any other code sharing platform).

## Challenges
To give you a short glimpse of what we expect, you can look at some of the ideas we propose below. However, feel free to design and develop anything else that you think could help us in our mission to improve breast cancer detection and treatment in Mexico.
- **Early Detection**: Develop tools and technologies to improve early diagnosis.
- **Access to Care**: Enhance access to screening and treatment in rural and underserved areas.
- **Patient Support**: Create platforms or apps to provide support and resources to patients and their families.
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize data analytics to identify trends and improve treatment outcomes.

As a final note, we want to emphasize that the goal of this hackathon is to foster collaboration and innovation in addressing breast cancer and environmental contaminants in Mexico. We encourage you to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions that can make a real difference in the lives of women in Mexico. Similar efforts have been made in other occasions, where small teams have developed solutions that have had a significant impact on the lives of thousands of people and / or helped people, decision- and policy-makers in day-to-day decision-making. We share some of the publications and tools (might give you some ideas) that have been developed in the past:
- [How to get-toilet-paper.com? Provision of Information as a Public Good](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3866801)
- [Predicting poverty and wealth from mobile phone metadata](https://dlab.epfl.ch/teaching/spring2019/cs718/papers/blumenstock2015predicting.pdf)
- [Internal Migrations prediction and data-informed policy-making in Serbia](https://didexwb.streamlit.app/Internal_Migrations_DEX_Model)

## Visualizations
Just to give you a glimpse of the what is available within the data, please observe the following visualizations and their interpretations.

The map of San Luis Potosi in Mexico displays the population distribution across various regions within the city. The regions are color-coded to represent different population densities:
- Light Green (1 - 2,556): Areas with the lowest population density.
- Moderate Green (2,557 - 5,111): Regions with moderate population density.
- Medium Green (5,112 - 7,666): Areas with higher population density.
- Dark Green (7,667 - 10,221): Regions with very high population density.
- Deep Green (10,222 - 12,776): Areas with the highest population density.
- White: Unpopulated areas.

![San Louis Potosi - Population Map](images/total_population_in_splma.png)

As one can observe, the central parts of San Luis Potosi have higher population densities, as seen by the darker shades of green, suggesting more urbanization and residential concentration. Peripheral areas exhibit a mix of moderate to low population densities, with some unpopulated regions.

In addition to the population map, one can also create a layout of streets and the distribution of schools across the city. The roads are color-coded to differentiate between various types, and schools are marked with red circles. 

![San Louis Potosi - Streets and Schools](images/streets_and_schools.png)

The central part of San Luis Potosi has a dense network of streets, avenues, and other road types, indicating a well-developed urban infrastructure. Not surprisingly, the outskirts have fewer roads, with more beltways and extensions, suggesting less urbanization. Access to education is more-or-less well distributed with schools dispersed throughout the city. A higher concentration is in central areas, ensuring accessibility for most residents.

Another interesting data source is marginalization index. The marginalization index is a composite measure that evaluates the degree of exclusion or deprivation experienced by individuals or groups within a specific area, considering factors such as economic, social, and living conditions. It helps identify regions with higher levels of marginalization, guiding policy interventions and resource allocation to improve living standards and reduce inequality.

![San Louis Potosi - Marginalization Index](images/marginalization_in_splma.png)

Areas are color-coded to represent varying levels of marginalization: very low (light pink), low (light red), medium (red), high (dark red), and very high (deep red). The central and some peripheral regions exhibit higher levels of marginalization, indicating significant exclusion and deprivation, whereas other parts of the city show lower levels of marginalization. This visualization might help in solving some of the tasks of this hackathon by identifying the most marginalized areas that require targeted interventions to improve living conditions and social inclusion.

Finally, one can see the polution index and polution sources. In other words, one can observe the level of pollutants in the environment, indicating areas with poor air quality or high contamination. Pollution sources, such as factories, traffic, and waste sites, contribute to higher pollution levels, affecting public health and the environment.

![San Louis Potosi - Polution Index](images/kde_stationary_pollution_sources.png)

The map of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, shows the distribution of pollution levels and sources within the city. Areas with darker red shades indicate higher pollution levels, particularly concentrated in the northern and central parts of the city. Black dots represent stationary pollution sources, such as industrial sites, which are densely clustered in these high-pollution areas, highlighting the significant impact of industrial activity on air quality in these regions.
