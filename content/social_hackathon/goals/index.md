## The Social Hackathon Vision

The Social Hackathon is more than a competition—it’s a call to action for the EAAMO community. This initiative is designed to harness the power of algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, coupled with insights from the social sciences and humanistic studies, to tackle pressing social issues. Local partners provide curated datasets and extensive context on these issues, aiming to incorporate insights from impacted communities and policymakers. The goal is to create practical tools that bridge the research-to-practice pipeline. Winning teams will continue collaborating with policymakers to refine and implement their solutions.

## Broad-Level Goals

For this year's Social Hackathon, we are honored to collaborate with Professor Jacqueline Calderon from the Medical School of UASLP and a visiting professor at Boston College. Professor Calderon has curated a comprehensive dataset that includes geotagged rates of environmental contaminants (air pollution, lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and water pollution), along with breast cancer incidence rates in San Luis Potosi and across Mexico. The broad goals of this hackathon are:

1. **Understanding Disparities**: Extend our understanding of the relationship between breast cancer mortality, environmental carcinogens, healthcare, and social disparities among Mexican women.
2. **Creating Dynamic Surveillance Platforms**: Develop a platform for storing, sharing, and analyzing unified databases to identify populations at high risk of breast cancer mortality due to aggregated and cumulative environmental hazards, healthcare infrastructure, and social disadvantages.
3. **Nurturing Digital Ecosystems**: Create a digital ecosystem to visualize temporal and spatial trends at different geographical levels, monitor and predict breast cancer disparities, and provide evidence for decision-makers to strengthen the healthcare system.
4. **Enhancing Technical Capabilities**: Enhance technical capabilities by incorporating cutting-edge technologies to update the healthcare system and provide expert training and support.

## Specific Goals
1. **Priority 1—Improve Public Health Decisions**: Develop novel surveillance systems incorporating algorithms to identify high-risk populations and characterize environmental carcinogen hazards, medical infrastructure, and social environments.
2. **Priority 2—Reduce Barriers to Healthcare**: Improve healthcare access by creating bridges between individuals most in need and healthcare facilities.
3. **Priority 3—Risk Tools**: Enhance breast cancer risk estimation by incorporating environmental carcinogen risks, healthcare access, and social hazards into risk tools, such as the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool by the NCI.
4. **Priority 4—Science Education**: Develop digital tools to translate scientific evidence regarding breast cancer for individuals, communities, and public policy, improving public health decision-making.
