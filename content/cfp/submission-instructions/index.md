## Conference Proceedings
Submissions will have the option to be either archival or non-archival. For papers in disciplinary areas where archival conference papers are the norm, preference will be given to archival submissions.

### Archival
Accepted papers that select archival submission will be published in the conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. The archival track welcomes submissions that constitute new research papers that have not been published in conference proceedings or journals before. 

### Non-archival
This track welcomes unpublished work, work under simultaneous submission to a journal or conference (in compliance with the rules of the other venue), and research papers that have been published recently, no later than January 1, 2024. If the work is already published, please include a citation in the submission system. Papers in the non-archival track will not be published as part of the conference proceedings and may be submitted in the future to an archival venue, if not already published. 
Poster presentations: Submissions in either track may also be accepted as a non-archival poster presentation. This allows authors to present work to the community at a poster session and does not result in a publication in the conference proceedings. 

## Formatting
There are no formatting or length requirements for the PDF submission, but accepted archival papers will have a page limit of at most 14 pages in the camera-ready version at the time of publication, using the ACM Traditional Camera Ready Submission template. In addition to the PDF, authors are asked to upload a 200-250 word description in the submission system summarizing their submission and its relevance to the conference.

## Anonymity
Submissions are double-blind. Authors should take care to not include the names and affiliations of the authors in the paper, including when referring to previous work. Submitters should list all co-authors on the submitted work in EasyChair but not in the PDF of the submission. Citations to the authors’ own previous work should be written in the third person; e.g., instead of “We previously developed…(Smith, 2019)”, write “Smith (2019) previously developed…”. If this would compromise the clarity of the paper (i.e., it is necessary to identify previous work as belonging to the authors), use an anonymous citation, e.g., (Anonymous, 2019). These can be replaced in the camera-ready version. Additionally, wherever possible, authors should avoid referring to specific institutional details in the paper which could reveal their names or affiliations (for example “our team included officials from a large U.S. city” instead of “our team included officials from New York City”). However, institutional information may be included if it is necessary to the research content of the paper, even if it is suggestive of author affiliations.

## Ethical considerations
Papers submitted to EAAMO are expected to engage with ethical challenges and implications of the work presented, and the review process will consider the soundness of such engagement alongside technical soundness. We strongly encourage papers to include a discussion of ethical concerns or unintended adverse impacts that could result from the publication of the work, along with any precautions taken to mitigate these issues. For papers accepted in the archival track, this discussion may be included in a separate statement (up to 1 page long) that does not count towards the overall page limit.

For research that involves human participants or that uses sensitive data, it is particularly important that the paper describe steps taken to adhere to ethical norms for human subjects research, e.g., informed consent, protection of privacy, and how risks to participants were assessed and handled. The paper should also include disclosure regarding whether the study was approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) if such review is required (e.g., for human subjects research conducted by members of a university).

## Language
We will only accept submissions in the English language. The conference is committed to building multilingual communities, and aims to allow submissions in other languages at future events.


## Financial support
We aim to increase accessibility by offering financial assistance to attend the conference. The application for this program will be available soon.

## ACM policies
By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all [ACM Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM's new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
 
Please ensure that you and your co-authors [obtain an ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/register), so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.  ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a [commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
