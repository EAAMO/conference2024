- determinants and causes of harm including inequitable outcomes, market failures, exploitative behavior, and economic inefficiencies
- machine learning, optimization, and mechanism design for alleviating inefficiencies, inequitable, and unsafe economic and social outcomes
- uncertainty, safety, privacy, and equity in allocative and representational systems
- algorithmic, ethical, policy, and societal challenges in computing in resource-constrained settings
- reliable, trustworthy, and valid inference in societally-consequential domains
- data collection, curation, governance, protection, and sharing efforts for work related to improving access to opportunity
- algorithmic approaches and tools to encourage participation, empower, and organize communities for the collective good
- regulation and policy design related to data, privacy, equity, fairness, and access to opportunity

Application areas of interest include civic participation, data economies, discrimination and bias, digital and economic inequalities, economic development, education, environment and climate, food security, healthcare, housing, infrastructure, labor markets, law and policy, low- and under-resourced computing, social and economic mobility, privacy, public service provision, recommender systems, social work, sustainable development, and transportation. Our list of topics is broad, illustrating how various perspectives and disciplinary approaches can triangulate progress on focus areas of shared interest.
