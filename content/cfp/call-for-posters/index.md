The fourth ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO ‘24) will take place October 29-31, 2024, in San Luis Potosi, Mexico at the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí ([UASLP](https://www.uaslp.mx/)). The event will highlight work along the research-to-practice pipeline to improve access to opportunity for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities and mitigate harms concerning inequitable and unsafe outcomes. In particular, we seek contributions from different fields that offer insights into the intersectional design and impacts of algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design with a grounding in the social sciences and humanistic studies. Submissions include research, surveys, position papers, and problem- and practice-driven submissions by academics and practitioners from different disciplines or sectors.

In this call, we invite submissions for poster presentations. Accepted submissions will be presented at a poster session during the conference (which will be held in English). Submissions through this call will only be required to provide a title and abstract (though authors are encouraged to upload a full paper) via a submission form available at this [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHma3y_vN4yd_nqnSXgMe65ZeMdbCPCU-UyxKs2ew1IixqFA/viewform?usp=sf_link). The review process will focus largely on fit with the mission of EAAMO and likely interest to the EAAMO community. Given the conference location in Mexico this year, we welcome submissions that provide novel insights into issues of relevance in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region.

Note that posters do not result in an accepted paper and are fully compatible with later submission of the work to a peer-reviewed venue. EAAMO traditionally offers poster presentations to some papers submitted through the regular call for papers that were not accepted as full papers, but that would interest the community. This year, we are offering an additional opportunity to submit for consideration solely as a poster with a later deadline.

**Deadline: August 26, 2024**

**Author notification: September 2, 2024**

**Submission Link:** [Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHma3y_vN4yd_nqnSXgMe65ZeMdbCPCU-UyxKs2ew1IixqFA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## Areas of Interest

We invite submissions on topics, methodologies, and approaches including, but not limited to:
- ethical, economic, legal, philosophical, and societal considerations of algorithmically-driven interventions
- redistributive mechanisms for improving access to opportunity and equitable outcomes
- micro- and macroeconomic consequences of inequality and market inefficiencies
- determinants and causes of harm, including inequitable outcomes, market failures, exploitative behavior, and economic inefficiencies
- machine learning, optimization, and mechanism design for alleviating inefficiencies, inequitable, and unsafe economic and social outcomes
- uncertainty, safety, privacy, and equity in allocative and representational systems
- algorithmic, ethical, policy, and societal challenges in computing in resource-constrained settings
- reliable, trustworthy, and valid inference in societally-consequential domains
- data collection, curation, governance, protection, and sharing efforts for work related to improving access to opportunity
- algorithmic approaches and tools to encourage participation, empower, and organize communities for the collective good
- regulation and policy design related to data, privacy, equity, fairness, and access to opportunity

Application areas of interest include civic participation, data economies, discrimination and bias, digital and economic inequalities, economic development, education, environment and climate, food security, healthcare, housing, infrastructure, labor markets, law and policy, low- and under-resourced computing, social and economic mobility, privacy, public service provision, recommender systems, social work, sustainable development, and transportation. Our broad list of topics illustrates how various perspectives and disciplinary approaches can triangulate progress on focus areas of shared interest.
